#The PRIMATE Primer: 
###Viewing Behavior Statistics from Rhesus Macaques During Free Viewing of Natural Scenes


The data used for these results is [here](http://research.yerkes.emory.edu/Buffalo/Repository/Data/The%20PRIMATE%20Primer%20Data.mat).  

The results were obtained using a combination of the [Cluster Fixation Detector](../../General Tools/Useful Functions/ClusterFixationDetector) and the scripts in the [Salience / Viewing Behavior](../../Projects/Salience and Viewing Behavior) Project.
