Don't run from the S Drive or save anything to the S drive
	-it is too slow
1. edit the cortex timing files with the lines of code given in saveMovieTriggered.m
2. edit the save location, monkey name, and arduino com port if you have unplugged/replugged the arduino for any reason (find the com port in device manager)
3. run saveMovieTriggered.m from the C drive
4. if saving .mat files, run the code at the end to convert the .mat files to .wmv files


see the saveMovieTriggered.m comments for instructions to setup on a new computer
