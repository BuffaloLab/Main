This task teaches the animal to simply touch, hold, and release the bar for reward.  

Have the monkey do each of the following three steps in the given order (don't move onto a next step until the previous one is thoroughly mastered):

1. [Bar1](https://github.com/BuffaloLab/BehavioralTasks/tree/master/Bar/Bar1) - As long as the animal is making contact with the touchbar, it is continuously rewarded.
2. [Bar2](https://github.com/BuffaloLab/BehavioralTasks/tree/master/Bar/Bar2) - The animal gets rewarded once every time it touches the bar, but must let go and grab the bar again to receive another reward.
3. [Bar3](https://github.com/BuffaloLab/BehavioralTasks/tree/master/Bar/Bar3) - Same as Bar2, except the animal is required to hold the bar for 600ms each time to get rewarded.
