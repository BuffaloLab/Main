##Bar

This task teaches the animal to simply touch, hold, and release the bar for reward. Big, random-colored squares appear on the screen, but the animal isn't forced to meaningfully interact with them.  The purpose of the colorful squares is merely to get the animal used to the idea of flashing things on the screen and that they might signify something.  In this case, they merely signify that the bar is being held.

### Training Steps
There are three .sav files (Bar.sav, Bar2.sav, and Bar3.sav), and each represents a training step.  The only difference between the .sav files are their respective timing files (Bar.tim, Bar2.tim, Bar3.tim).  Have the monkey do each of the following three steps in the given order (don't move onto a next step until the previous one is thoroughly mastered):

1. Bar.sav - As long as the animal is making contact with the touchbar, it is continuously rewarded.  A big, random-colored square appears on the screen to accompany each reward.
2. Bar2.sav - The animal gets rewarded once every time it touches the bar, but must let go and grab the bar again to receive another reward.  The big, random-colored square appears when the animal touches the bar, and disappears when the animal lets go.
3. Bar3.sav - Same as Bar2, except the animal is required to hold the bar for 600ms each time to get rewarded.   The big, random-colored square appears as soon as the bar is grabbed, and disappears when the animal lets go.
