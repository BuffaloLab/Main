## ClrChng Grid

This is a version of the ClrChng task that is particularly useful for post-hoc analysis and callibration.  Make a grid of clrchng stimuli of whatever dimensions and spacing you like (using [makeCCHGrid.m](makeCCHGrid.m) to create the .itm and .cnd files), and then run the task using the [ClrCgF.tim](ClrCgF.tim) file given here, which is just the regular clrchng .tim file except that it also requires fixation.  How long to require for fixation (also = how long to display the stimuli) is a matter of some controversy in the lab for now, so use whatever you want by changing the mintim and maxtim variables in the .tim file.
