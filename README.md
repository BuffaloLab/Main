In this repository, you can find all of the MATLAB scripts we have used to analyze various experimental data.

## Core/Essential Functions
The following is a list of some of the most important and useful functions:  

* [get_ALLdata](/BuffaloLab/Functions/tree/master/get_ALLdata) - This function extracts EOG and EPP data from the CORTEX data file.

## Projects 
Here we will link to wiki pages documenting the code for each project pursued by an individual(s), even those that didn't necessarily go anywhere.  This would have a lot of overlap with the below 2 categories, but that's probably fine.  Say, for example, I set out to look at the eye data from all tasks we've used, looking to find some sort of pattern.  It would go here.  If the project is aborted, it would stay here.  Perhaps have a sub-heading for aborted or dropped projects.  

## Tasks [[Files](https://github.com/BuffaloLab/BehavioralTasks)]
### First: Training a New Animal
When we have a brand new monkey, it must be trained to know the basics before it can really do any of our main experimental tasks.  Mainly, the monkey must realize that the touchbar is an important and meaningful tool for it.  It can receive reward by holding and releasing the touchbar when appropriate.

We train the monkey in the basics of daily work in our lab by teaching it Bar, ClrChng, and DMS (the three tasks enumerated below), in that order.  Click on each task to learn more about it, get the necessary files, training instructions, and analysis scripts.

1. [Bar](wiki/Bar) - This task teaches the animal to simply touch, hold, and release the bar for reward.
2. [ClrChng](wiki/ClrChng) - The animal is asked to hold the touchbar for a small gray square to appear and then release whenever the square turns yellow.  A simple task that is later used for eyetracking calibration when the animal is headposted.  
3. [Delayed Match-to-Sample (DMS)](wiki/Delayed-Match-to-Sample-%28DMS%29) - For this task, the monkey must remember a stimulus until it is presented again after several distractor images.

### Advanced Behavioral Tasks

* Visual Preferential Looking Task (VPLT)
* Visual Paired Comparison(VPC)
* T's and L's
* Scene Manipulation (SCM)
* Orientation Task
