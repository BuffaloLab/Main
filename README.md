### First: Training a New Animal
When we have a brand new monkey, it must be trained to know the basics before it can really do any of our main experimental tasks.  Mainly, the monkey must realize that the touchbar is an important and meaningful tool for it.  It can receive reward by holding and releasing the touchbar when appropriate.

We train the monkey in the basics of daily work in our lab by teaching it Bar, ClrChng, and DMS (the three tasks enumerated below), in that order.  Click on each task to learn more about it, get the necessary files, training instructions, and analysis scripts.

1. [Bar](https://github.com/BuffaloLab/Main/wiki/Bar) - This task teaches the animal to simply touch, hold, and release the bar for reward.
2. [ClrChng](https://github.com/BuffaloLab/Main/wiki/ClrChng) - The animal is asked to hold the touchbar for a small gray square to appear and then release whenever the square turns yellow.  A simple task that is later used for eyetracking calibration when the animal is headposted.  
3. [Delayed Match-to-Sample (DMS)](https://github.com/BuffaloLab/Main/wiki/Delayed-Match-to-Sample-%28DMS%29) - For this task, the monkey must remember a stimulus until it is presented again after several distractor images.
